## `tst_crossover_pt_1.c`

Compute the average crossover point in several tests between brute-force algorithm and recursive algorithm for the maximum-subarray problem.


## `tst_crossover_pt_2.c`

Compute the average crossover point in several tests between brute-force algorithm and hybrid algorithm (recursive + brute-force) for the maximum-subarray problem.

## `tst_perf.c`

Options: `size`

```
./tst_perf [size]
```
