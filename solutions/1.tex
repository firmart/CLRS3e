\section{The Role of Algorithms in Computing}

\subsection{Algorithms}

\begin{description}
  \item[1.1-1] {\itshape Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.}

    \begin{exrev}
      
    \end{exrev}

  \item[1.1-2] {\itshape Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?}

    \begin{exrev}
      
    \end{exrev}

  \item[1.1-3] {\itshape Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.}

    \begin{exrev}
      
    \end{exrev}

  \item[1.1-4] {\itshape How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?}

    \begin{exrev}
      
    \end{exrev}

  \item[1.1-5] {\itshape Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is “approximately” the best is good enough.}


\end{description}

\subsection{Algorithms as a technology}

\begin{description}
  \item[1.2-1] {\itshape Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.}

    \begin{exrev}
      
    \end{exrev}

  \item[1.2-2] {\itshape Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size $n$, insertion sort runs in $8n^2$ steps, while merg sort runs in $64n\lg n$ steps. For which values of $n$ does insertion sort beat merge sort?}

    \begin{exrev}
      
    \end{exrev}

  \item[1.2-3] {\itshape What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is $100n^2$ runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is $2^n$ on the same machine?}

    \begin{exrev}
      
    \end{exrev}  

\end{description}

\subsection{Problems} 

\begin{description}
  \item[1-1] \textbf{\itshape Comparison of running times}

    {\itshape For each function $f(n)$ and time $t$ in the following table, determine the largest size $n$ of a problem that can be solved in time $t$, assuming that the algorithm to solve the problem takes $f(n)$ microseconds.}
